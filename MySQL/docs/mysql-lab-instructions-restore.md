# MySQL Lab - Restore MySQL Backup to Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server #

In the next set of exercises, we will use Azure MySQL Import to restore the database backup taken in the previous exercises, into Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server.  Note that there is no need to stand up a MySQL Flexible Server beforehand, as the migration utility deploys the server as part of the migration.
